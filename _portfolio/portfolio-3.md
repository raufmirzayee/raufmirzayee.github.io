**Project Description:** To improve the accuracy of our Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) system for Afghan number plates, I created a dataset and generated synthetic (fake) number plates using data augmentation techniques. This enhanced the diversity of the dataset and improved the model's performance in detecting real-world variations.
