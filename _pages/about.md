Data Scientist focused on Product Analytics currently in the Travel Tech industry. 

About Me
======

My current work focuses on product analytics and typically includes advanced analysis, A/B (hypothesis) testing, predictive modeling, and defining new metrics. Recently I looked at the impact of [user effort on business outcomes](https://github.com/maggiewolff/user-effort-index/blob/main/IDEAL%20-%20Maggie%20Wolff%20-%20User%20Effort.pdf). I also enjoy mentoring and [knowledge sharing](/talks/) with colleagues and others in the industry. 

In my spare time, I like solving my own problems with data, such as creating [my own recommender model](https://github.com/maggiewolff/running_clothes_recommender) to figure out what to wear when running through another chilly Chicago winter. 

I'm currently working in the travel tech industry analyzing user experiences for a corporate travel booking platform. I have an MS in Data Science (plus that BA in Communication). I'm an ambassador for [Women in Data Science (WiDS)](http:/www.widsconference.org), an organizer for [MeasureCamp Chicago](https://chicago.measurecamp.org/), and help oversee a mentorship program for [Data Angels](http://dataangels.org/), a Slack community for women in data.

However, I haven't always worked with data. Despite a love of math and coding when I was a teenager (I went to the Math Olympics in elementary school and was on Mathletes in high school), I took a detour in college to study Communication and started my career in marketing and public relations. It sounded glamorous and exciting but turned out to be a bad fit for my natural abilities. I kept gravitating towards more technical responsibilities, eventually finding myself in a marketing analytics role in 2016 - and absolutely loving it. But my liberal arts background meant I had many skill gaps required for an analytics career, so I enrolled in a graduate data science program part-time while working full-time, to learn everything I possibly could about working with data. 

Learning data science and working in analytics has been a perfect fit for my calculator brain, but also provides great opportunities to communicate complex messages - which I still enjoy despite pivoting away from my original career path.  

In my free time, I dance (and occasionally perform) with the [Chicago Chorus Girls project](https://www.instagram.com/chicagochorusgirls/) and work out with [November Project Chicago](https://www.instagram.com/novemberprojectchicago/).
