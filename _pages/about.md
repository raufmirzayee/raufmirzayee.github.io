A passionate Data Scientist and Software Engineery. 

# About Me  

I am a Data Scientist passionate about machine learning, data analysis, and using technology for impactful solutions. My academic and professional journey focuses on applying data science techniques to real-world challenges, especially in fields like automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) systems, electronic toll collection, and predictive modeling in healthcare.

Currently, I am preparing to pursue my master's degree in **Data Science at Arden University, Berlin**. I hold multiple certifications, including the **IBM Data Science Professional Certificate** and the **Google Data Analytics Certificate**, and have completed several other courses on **Kaggle, FutureLearn,** and **Udemy** to continuously expand my knowledge.

## Professional Experience  
My work has spanned across multiple fields, from developing management information systems (MIS) to applying machine learning models for healthcare predictions. Some of my notable projects include:  
- **Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) System:** Coordinated and contributed to an ANPR-based electronic toll collection system, focusing on data collection, augmentation, and model training.  
- **Skill Delivery Project:** Used hospital data to build a machine learning model that predicted health outcomes for mothers and children with high accuracy.  
- **ICDL Instructor:** Teaching and empowering Afghan girls through digital literacy at **Youth Network Hub (YNH)**.

In addition, I have held positions as an IT Technician at Kabul University and an English Literature Teacher at Payame Noor Academy.

## My Journey into Data Science  
My passion for technology and problem-solving led me to transition into data science. While working on various projects, I realized the power of data in transforming businesses and improving lives. I dedicated myself to mastering Python, machine learning, and data analytics to make a meaningful impact through my work.  

## Interests and Hobbies  
In my free time, I enjoy learning new technologies, participating in coding competitions, and teaching others. I believe in the power of education and knowledge sharing to inspire change and growth.
